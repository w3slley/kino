## Usage
If you would like to run the application locally, first clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/w3slley/kino.git
cd kino
```
In one terminal run the Node.js server

```
node index.js
```

and in another run the React development server

```
cd frontend
npm start
```

Wait for the browser to open at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tech stack
The web application was developed using Node.js and MongoDB on the back-end and React.js on the front end. The deployment was made on Heroku.

The [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/) API was used to retreive all the movie information and the YouTube API was used to get the trailer for each movie.

The authentication system was implemented on the browser using `LocalStorage`.

It's worth poiting out that the field `YoutubeId` on the previous response corresponds to a video unique identifier which is used to render the YouTube video on a movie page (the url of a video is `https://youtube.com/watch?v=:YoutubeId`). And this data field doesn't come from OMDB itself: it is retreived from the YouTube API and then appended to the response body. 

Therefore, to minimize calls both to the back-end API and also to the public APIs used, a decision was made to make one call to `/movies/search` to get a list of movies related to the users' search term and another call to `/movies/:imdbId` to display the movie information on its unique page.
